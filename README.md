C++ Banking Management System
This is a simple, command-line Banking Management System developed in C++. It offers essential banking functionalities for managing customer accounts, including creation, modification, deletion, and financial transactions like deposits and withdrawals. The system uses binary files for robust data persistence and secures sensitive operations with a master key.

‚ú® Features
Robust Master Key Management: The system employs a dedicated master key to safeguard sensitive operations such as viewing all customer data and changing the master key itself. This key is stored persistently in a binary file (MasterKey.dat), ensuring it survives program restarts.
Comprehensive Customer Account Operations:
Create New Account: Add new customer accounts, ensuring each account is assigned a unique ID (referred to as "Pin Code" in the code). The system checks for duplicate IDs to maintain data integrity.
Modify Customer Data: Update the details of an existing customer's account, such as name or other relevant information (assuming the BANK::Modify() method handles this).
Delete Customer Record: Permanently remove customer accounts from the system. This process involves copying all non-deleted records to a temporary file (Temp.dat) and then replacing the main data file (Bankdata.dat), a standard and effective method for deleting records in binary files.
View Individual Account: Display the specific details of a single customer account by its ID.
View All Accounts: List all customer accounts, including their names, IDs, and current balances. Access to this feature is restricted and requires the correct Master Key for security.
Essential Financial Transactions:
Deposit Funds: Allows customers to add money to their accounts, updating the balance instantly in the persistent storage.
Withdraw Funds: Enables customers to withdraw money from their accounts, with the balance being updated in the data file.
Binary File Storage for Persistence: All customer account data and the master key are stored efficiently and persistently in binary files (Bankdata.dat and MasterKey.dat respectively). This ensures that all information remains intact even after the program is closed, providing a reliable data storage solution.
üìÅ Project Structure
The project is structured using object-oriented programming principles, making it modular and extensible:

main.cpp: This is the application's entry point. It displays the main menu, takes user input for navigation, and calls the appropriate member functions of the Binary class to perform banking operations.
Binary.h: This header file declares the Binary class, which serves as the central manager for all banking operations, including file I/O and master key handling.
Binary.cpp: This file contains the full implementation of the Binary class methods declared in Binary.h. It defines the detailed logic for reading from and writing to binary files, manipulating account data, and executing financial transactions.
BANK.h: (Crucial Implied Dependency) This header file must define the BANK class. This class represents an individual customer's bank account, holding data members such as customer name, ID (Pin Code), and balance. It's expected to provide methods like CreateAccount(), ShowData(), Modify(), AddDeposit(), Withdraw(), GetcustomerId(), and showAll(), which are essential for the Binary class to function.
MasterKey.dat: (Generated by the system) A binary file dedicated to securely storing the Master Key.
Bankdata.dat: (Generated by the system) A binary file used to store all customer account records.
Temp.dat: (Temporary file) Used during the account deletion process to rebuild the Bankdata.dat file without the deleted record.
üõ†Ô∏è How to Compile and Run
Prerequisites
You'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common choices include g++ (part of GCC, available on Linux, macOS, and via MinGW on Windows).

Compilation
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory, where all your .cpp and .h files are located.

Compile the source files. If you're using g++, the standard compilation command will be:

Bash

g++ main.cpp Binary.cpp -o banking_system
Important: If your BANK class has its own .cpp implementation file (e.g., BANK.cpp), you must include it in the compilation command:

Bash

g++ main.cpp Binary.cpp BANK.cpp -o banking_system
Running the Application
After successful compilation, execute the program from your terminal:

Bash

./banking_system
On Windows, you would typically run it like this:

Bash

.\banking_system.exe
üöÄ How to Use
When you launch the application, you'll be greeted by the Main Menu:

    Main Menu

1: Add New Customer
2: Modify Customer Data
3: Show Customer Data
4: Show All Customer Data
5: Delete Customer Record
6: Deposit Amount
7: Withdraw Amount
8: Change Master Key
9: Exit

Enter your choice:
Default Master Key: For administrative operations requiring the Master Key (such as "Show All Customer Data" or "Change Master Key"), the initial Master Key is 0000. Remember to input this value accurately when prompted.
Customer ID (Pin Code): Customer accounts are uniquely identified by an integer ID. When interacting with specific accounts, you'll be asked to provide this ID.
Simply follow the clear, on-screen prompts and provide the requested information to perform any banking operation.
üí° Key Design Choices and Considerations
Direct Binary File I/O: The system utilizes fstream to perform direct binary reads and writes of BANK objects. This method is generally efficient for storing structured data and provides a compact file size compared to text-based storage.
Master Key Protection: The inclusion of a master key adds a basic layer of security, restricting access to sensitive administrative features to authorized users.
"Pin Code" as ID: The use of "Pin Code" in checkSamekey implies that the customer ID also functions as a personal identification number. For real-world systems, these would typically be separate for security reasons.
Error Handling: While Binary.cpp includes basic checks for file opening errors, for a more robust production-ready application, you'd want to expand error handling. This could include validating user inputs (e.g., ensuring numeric input, preventing non-positive deposit/withdrawal amounts) and handling edge cases within the BANK class's methods.
Security Best Practices: Storing the master key directly in a binary file without further encryption (beyond the int type's inherent binary representation) is a fundamental security measure. For any real-world banking system, sophisticated encryption techniques would be paramount.
Platform-Dependent Console Functions: The system("cls") and system("color") calls in main.cpp for console manipulation are platform-dependent. While perfectly functional for this type of project, cross-platform applications might use libraries like ncurses or ANSI escape codes for better portability.
Feel free to explore the code, experiment with its features, and consider how you might expand or improve upon this foundational banking system!
